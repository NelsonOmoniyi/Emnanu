            <h3>Sustaining the Resources that Sustain Us</h3>
            <p class="font-petrov sans">
            The challenges we face today are interrelated and canâ€™t be solved by only one person. We are dedicated to studying, understanding, and committing time and resources to solve the problems of hunger, illiteracy, and poverty. 
            <br> <br>
            In the next few years, we have prioritized three objectives that align with our organization's core value:
            <br>
            <br>
           <b class="fst-italics"> 1. Direct Action</b>
           <br>
            We work with target groups like orphanage homes, hospitals, special disabilities centers, and individuals in the community, providing them with food and other relief materials. <br> <br>
           <b class="fst-italics"> 2. Equity</b>
           <br>
            We believe strongly that all humans matter regardless of race, gender, physical or mental abilities. We are all equal and deserve a good and happy life. <br> <br>
           <b class="fst-italics"> 3. Partnership</b>
           <br>
            We are open to new partnerships, ideas, and strategies, as this will enable us to reach out to a wider audience.

                  We plan to achieve an 80 percent reduction in Adamawa State's poverty level by 2025. Emnamu Foundation is also working tirelessly to ensure the disabled are empowered.
                  <br> <br>
                  Because we believe there's a correlation between poverty and illiteracy, we plan to get all children of school age that are in the street into schools by 2030. Finally, we plan to make Adamawa the leading state in infrastructure and development in the near future.
