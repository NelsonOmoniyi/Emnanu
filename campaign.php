                  Hunger and disease are two significant challenges the less privileged face every day. The Emnamu Foundation, in its recent campaigns, has reached out to over 30,000 economically disadvantaged and disabled persons across eight local governments through our various outreach programs. <br><br>
                  We donated wheelchairs, clothes, sewing machines, and various food items to thousands of beneficiaries. We also gave cash donations to assist over 50 sick persons in the hospital.
                  <br> <br>
                  In commemoration of 2021 menstrual hygiene day, we sensitized young girls on the importance of maintaining good personal hygiene and donated sanitary pads and other toiletries.
