          Our foundation strives to eradicate abject poverty and empower citizens with special disabilities. All of our activities are based on actionable information that helps inform our strategies. 
          <br> <br>
          Priorities govern our strategies. These priorities are areas that demand immediate response and will have the most significant impact on the lives of the people.

          <p class="font-petrov sans">
          Our organizational objectives are focused on poverty alleviation, quality education, and skill empowerment. These problems have long existed and can’t be solved in the twinkle of an eye or by our foundation alone. 
          <br> <br>
          To achieve our organizational goals and objectives, we first identify the problem and then strategize with our partners and team members on the most effective ways to provide solutions to these challenges. 
            <br> <br>
          Then we collaborate with a team of smart volunteers and partners who are passionate about improving the lives of the needy and vulnerable in our society. 
          <br> <br>
          We also engage in partnership and appropriate revenue generation and fundraising activities to support the foundation’s goals and activities.

          <h3>How we develop our strategy</h3>
          <p class="font-petrov sans">
          In our various teams and locations, we evaluate our goals to know the most effective strategies commensurate with the available resources. 
          <br> <br>
          We also keep records of our progress and share valuable lessons and experiences. Alongside this process, we are in constant dialogue with our partners and sponsors.
          <br> <br>
          As an organization, our strategies are annually reviewed and amended where and when necessary.

          <h3>How we decide what to fund</h3>
          <p class="font-petrov sans">
          All our projects have resource allocations and duration. We work with our partners to research and propose projects aligned with our organizational objectives and priorities before taking actions.
          <br> <br>
          Our research process consists of four core phases: 
          <br> <br>
          Idea development phase: Here, we research and identify problems that align with our organizational objectives and prioritize them according to their level of urgency
          <br> <br>
         <b>1. Pre-proposal phase:</b>  We critically study and discuss the problem and its cause, before deciding on the most effective strategies to use
         <br> <br>
          <b>2. Investment phase:</b>  We review the strategies agreed upon and the available resources
          <br> <br>
          <b>3. Execution and close:</b> Finally, when resources are budgeted for a project, we go ahead to execute, take reports and document the experiences and lessons, which we will share later with our partners

          <h3>How we measure result</h3>
          <p class="font-petrov sans">
          According to a Sahara report news in 2019, the poverty rate in Adamawa state was estimated to be 75 percent of the entire population. 
          <br> <br>
          Over the last few years, our foundation has reached out to over 30,000 people across eight local governments through our outreach programs. 
          <br> <br>
          We consistently evaluate our progress after every project. That way, we understand the most effective strategies to use during future projects.

          <h3><b>Compassion </b></h3>
          One of the guiding principles that influences our actions at Emnamu Foundation is our compassion for people struggling to provide basic amenities. We believe everyone should have equal access to man's basic needs: food, shelter, and clothing. So we go out of our way to provide these for the underserved in Adamawa State.

We have clear-cut strategies for using the funds to achieve our poverty alleviation goals. Our partners are free to request for annual reports on fund disbursement.
