                        <p class="card-text">Stakeholders have asked government to support the girl child at the grassroots during their menstruation. <br>
                            Emnamu Foundation a volunteer group observed that, over the years managing menstrual period by girls at the tender age has become a source of concern as they lack basic knowledge on such natural phenomenon in Adamawa State.
                            In order to create awareness and provide education on the management of menstrual hygiene, World Menstrual Hygiene Day was introduced in 2014 to reduce infections associated to lack of proper management of menstruation.
                            <br><br>
                            The state coordinator of the foundation, Kukuya Godwin Kala’a said the foundation also focuses on gender-based violence where it stands for the protection of the right of the girl child.
                            He maintained that the foundation decided to organise the enlightenment campaign for those at the grassroots who may not have proper knowledge like the ones in the metropolitan areas.
                            Ndana’acha Suku described menstrual period as a natural opportunity given to every girl child, which needs good management or hygiene.

                        Kukuya revealed that  sports items such as basketballs, handballs, nets, and whistles were given to Hong metro town to propel unity and peaceful coexistence among the people. <br>
                        According to him, the presentation ended in grand style amidst fanfare, speeches, appreciation, gratitude prayers to Emmanuel who founded the group for the sole aim of supporting the downtrodden, vulnerable ones, less privileged and the physical challenged in the state. <br>
                        “The occasion climaxed with well-meaning citizens of Kala’a, Hong, Gombi and many communities who came out in their numbers to witness the grand finale celebration.” Kukuya said. <br>
                        Kukuya in the statement stated also that, Dr. Emmanuel is certainly not the richest man in Kilba Land, but his special nature and passion to humanity, caring for the poor, the downtrodden, the destitute, the old, and the people living with special challenges is second to none. <br>
                        “I want to use this occasion to call on the illustrious sons and daughters of Hong Local Government Area and Adamawa State at large to emulate a good example of Mr. Emmanuel, knowing that whosoever gives to the poor, lends to the creator,” Kukuya added. <br>
                        While commending security operatives, traditional and religious leaders, as well as members of the press for honouring the invitation, he called on the government to develop a deliberate bias in favor of the people living below the poverty line. <br>
                        He said, “if an individual can reach out to every nooks and crannies of the state to care for the sick, the poor and other vulnerable groups, there is no reason why the government cannot do  same. <br>
                        “It is clearly stated in our constitution that the primary responsibility of the government is the security and welfare of the citizens, sadly both are faced with a huge deficit.”
