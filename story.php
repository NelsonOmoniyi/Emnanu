                    Growing up in a society where most people live in extreme poverty and disabilities, it’s almost impossible for everyone to utilize their God-given talents and maximize their potentials. <br> <br>
                    Seeing this every day birthed the drive to put a smile on the faces of those who have almost lost hope due to a physical disability.<br> <br>
                    According to Robert M. Hensel, “being disabled shouldn’t mean being disqualified from having access to every aspect of life.”<br> <br>
                    This ideology is what drives us at Emnamu Foundation; we believe strongly that all lives matter and are equally important; no one can say otherwise except when we’re all given equal opportunities. Our organization advocates equity amongst persons with special disabilities and other members of society.<br> <br>
                    We also strongly believe that when we give to those who are in need, we don’t just give, but we lend to our creator. <br> <br>
                    The Emnamu Foundation is a registered nonprofit organization aimed at alleviating poverty, supporting the economically disadvantaged, vulnerable, less privileged, and physically challenged in society through educational intervention, health support, skill acquisition, and empowerment programs to facilitate independence and self-reliance.<br> <br>
                    The Emnamu Foundation also provides medical supplies, health centers, and sports facilities to areas in dire need of these social amenities.<br> <br>
                    At Emnamu Foundation, we see ability where there’s a disability, and we see hope where there seem to be none.
